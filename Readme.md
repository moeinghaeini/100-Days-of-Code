# 🐍 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2024

Welcome to my journey through the [**100 Days of Code - Python Bootcamp**](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?couponCode=JUNECP90625), an intensive course by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. This repository contains all my code, projects, and notes from the course — organized by day and topic.

## 📚 Course Overview

This course is a comprehensive, hands-on Python programming bootcamp covering:

- Python fundamentals & intermediate topics  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Web development with Flask  
- Data analysis and visualization  
- APIs and automation  
- Game development (Turtle, Tkinter)  
- Web scraping, GUI apps, and more!

> 💡 **Note:** The course follows a *project-based* approach — each day features a real-world project that solidifies the concepts learned.
